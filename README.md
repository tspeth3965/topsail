Use CSS Grid to rework the Visitors section of the Topsail Beach NC Website (Opens in new window) URL: https://topsailbeachnc.gov/Visitors/Things-To-Do  to be responsive using CSS Grid. You are not required to use the images on the site and you may benefit from finding copyright-free images of your own.  
Your goal for this project is to build an original, responsive website aimed at showcasing Topsail Beach as a tourist destination.  To this end, you will mainly be referencing the Visitors section of the site, turning it into a standalone site, curating and organizing the content for potential visitors to the area.  You are not expected to redesign the entire site - curate your content to your target audience!
While you are not required to link all the content from the original site, your final product should contain at least 4 functioning links (internal links to sections of a single-page site is fine).

The end product should be a minimum of FOUR linked HTML pages of your design:
HTML5 compliant (10%)
Example of a Web font (5%)
Visually appealing, using the principles of good design (15%)
Offer a excellent UX across all screen sizes (ultimately incorporating responsive design via CSS Grid) (20%)
Appropriate, accessible colors (10%)
Fully functional navigation with at least four links (10%)
Content is relevant and caters to its target market (10%)
Contain links to social media (5%)
Passes W3C Validation (10%)
Files Submitted to GitHub (5%)
Note:  You can use stock photos that you find on the Internet, providing you are not violating any copyright.
